<h1>Chemical Equilibrium with Applications for MATLAB</h1>

<p>This project aims to modify NASA's <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/">Chemical Equilibrium with Applications</a> to be able to use it's functionalities with MATLAB in a much easier and powerful way.</p>

<p>In the <emph>NasaSource</emph> folder there is all the original files downloaded straight from NASA's CEA website. However the FORTRAN source codes are commented for better comprehension of the way CEA works.</p>

<p>Once the FORTRAN source files will be completely anotated, a second folder will be created to hold all the modified files which are necessary for the functionning of the MATLAB API.</p>

<p>Lastly a third folder will be created which will contain the .mex64 files which will be ready to plug and play with MATLAB.</p>

<p>Created as a project in collaboration with École Polytechnique de Montréal</p>
